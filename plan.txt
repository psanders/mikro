Chat History

I need help here. This is for an AI communication excgange
I'm thinking on having one chat history per customer.

In the chat history I'm thinking on having:

AI:
Human: 
AI:
Human: (you get the idea)

One chat history per member or user.

Each message exchange should have the date and time of the message.

If the message was generated by AI it should also indicate any toolcalling (if any.)
